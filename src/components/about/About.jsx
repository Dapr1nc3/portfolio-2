          Hello, Welcome to my portfolio page! In the portfolio, you will see my
          projects, skills attained. Contact, and About me, sections are located
          on this portfolio. Now, to describe myself, and the things I like in a
          short paragraph is difficult, but in short, I love my family. I enjoy
          multiple outdoor activities, sports competitions, as well as....
          coding! I've always had an interest in it and how coding works, so I
          took the leap of faith in the area and wouldn't have imagined myself
          living at my desk. Enjoying the coding world is a big thing for me and
          it's very fun most of the time. I've met a lot of fun and interesting
          people in this field. Thanks for reading and again welcome to my
          Portfolio.
